# Dependency limits and typing library maintenance

# Keeps dependency suggestions and typing libraries within these constraints.

# - [python].version: used when suggesting/updating deps; should match requires-python.
# - [limits]: optional version caps for specific packages (e.g. django = ">=4,<6").
# - [typing_libraries].exclude: packages to never auto-add as typings.
# - [typing_libraries.module_to_package]: override module name -> types-* PyPI name.

# Optional: cap or pin specific runtime/dev packages across the workspace.
# Format: package_name = "version_spec" (e.g. ">=1.0,<3" or "~=2.4").
# Leave empty or omit to allow scripts to use latest within python version.

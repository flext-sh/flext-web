"""Test helpers for flext-web tests.

Provides reusable test utilities and helpers for all test modules.
Consolidates typings, models, and protocols in unified classes.

Uses standardized short names (m, t, p, u) for easy access in tests.
Helpers extend main classes and use same short names in place of base classes.

NOTE: Constants have been moved to tests/constants.py - import from tests.constants instead.

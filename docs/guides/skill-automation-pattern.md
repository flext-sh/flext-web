> Project profile: `flext-web`

Skills document intent and route execution to canonical owners. They do not
create parallel rule engines, registries, scripts, command grammars, or manual
consumer rewiring.

## Ownership

- Typed configuration owns enforceable policy data.
- Canonical `c`, `t`, `p`, `m`, and `u` facades own reusable declarations and
  behavior.
- flext-infra owns semantic discovery, ast-grep/Rope transformations, local LSP
  analysis, Git repositories, generation, and enforcement.
- ai-hub owns GitHub and CRG runtime services. FLEXT may consume its public
  commands, hooks, MCP routes, and daemons as optional enrichment, never as a
  library dependency; absence of that runtime is not an error.
- A skill points to those owners and explains when to use them.

Generated baselines, projections, and reports are evidence, never a writable
policy source or an allowlist.

## Required change shape

1. Research the current owner, consumers, fallbacks, tests, docs, and generated
   projections.
2. Encode the generalized invariant at its typed flext-infra owner.
3. Add a semantic transformation that can reproduce every consumer rewire.
4. Rewire consumers, remove the old owner, and prove zero residue.
5. Update the skill and canonical documentation in the same change.
6. Regenerate and run every declared gate.

Tests for skill automation use public facades, `tm`, the unified `conftest.py`,
and typed shared fixtures. Mocks, fakes, stubs, patching, private construction,
and hardcoded project-owned values are prohibited.

## Canonical execution

Run only from the workspace root:

```bash
make setup APPLY=Y
make help
make gen APPLY=Y
make mod APPLY=Y
make gen APPLY=Y
make gen APPLY=Y
make fix APPLY=Y
make fmt APPLY=Y
make check APPLY=Y
make test APPLY=Y
make conform APPLY=Y
make waza APPLY=Y
```

The final generation run proves the fixed point. `make mod APPLY=Y` owns
structural transformations; no direct script or tool invocation is valid.
`make test APPLY=Y` always retains Testmon.

Do not add project, file, pattern, action, phase, fix, or changed-only selectors.
A missing capability is implemented at the canonical Make/flext-infra owner
before the declared verb is rerun.

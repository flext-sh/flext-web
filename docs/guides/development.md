The root `AGENTS.md`, branch-matched `flext-law`, nearest package scope, and
active Bead define the development contract. This page is the executable
summary, not a second policy owner.

## Start at the workspace root

Discover and prepare the declared command surface before changing code:

```bash
make setup
make help
```

Use only verbs printed by `make help`. Do not add project, file, pattern,
changed-only, fix, or phase selectors to narrow a standard verb.

## Forward workflow

1. Read the canonical config, settings, generator, public facade, consumers,
   tests, and docs for the bounded change.
2. Use the semantic refactoring owner instead of manually rewiring consumers.
3. Remove the superseded owner in the same change and prove zero residue.
4. Regenerate every managed projection from its source.
5. Run the native gates without bypassing their orchestration.

```bash
make gen
make mod
make gen
make gen
make fix
make fmt
make check
make test
make conform
```

The final generation run proves the fixed point. The test verb always retains
and uses Testmon; a direct test-runner invocation is invalid evidence.

## Architecture and tests

- Generic reusable behavior survives in canonical `c`, `t`, `p`, `m`, or `u`
  ownership, with runtime behavior in `u`, services, `api.py`, or `cli.py`.
- Tests use public facades, `tm`, the unified `conftest.py`, and typed shared
  fixtures.
- Mocks, fakes, stubs, patching, private construction, duplicated setup, and
  hardcoded project-owned values are prohibited.
- Failures and warnings are corrected at their owning source, never suppressed,
  retried, normalized, or bypassed.

## Documentation ownership

Root guides are the writable source for generated member guides. Update the
root source, then use `make gen`; never hand-edit generated copies.

`flext_tests` is the shared test toolkit. It provides fixtures, matchers, file helpers, and a test runtime that binds
the canonical aliases.

## Aliases

```python

```

`flext_tests` reexports `d`, `e`, `h`, `r`, `x` from `flext_infra` and exposes domain helpers (`tk`, `td`, `tf`, `tv`,
`tm`).

| Alias | Purpose |
| ------- | --------- |
| `c` | constants |
| `e` | errors / exceptions (reexported) |
| `m` | models |
| `p` | protocols |
| `r` | result (reexported) |
| `s` | service / test runtime (`FlextTestsServiceBase`) |
| `t` | typings |
| `u` | utilities |

**Important:** `s` is the service/test-runtime alias. Test settings are accessed via `FlextTestsSettings` (no short
alias).

## Essential fixtures

Add `flext_tests` to your project test dependencies and use these fixtures in `conftest.py` or directly in tests:

| Fixture | Purpose |
| --------- | --------- |
| `reset_settings` | Resets `FlextSettings`, `FlextTestsSettings`, and `FlextContainer` singletons between tests (autouse). |
| `test_runtime` | Binds aliases (`c`, `e`, `m`, `p`, `r`, `s`, `t`, `u`) and `service`/`settings`/`logger` on class instances (autouse). |
| `settings` | Clean `FlextTestsSettings(debug=True, trace=False)`. |
| `settings_factory` | Factory for creating project-specific settings instances. |
| `temp_dir` / `temp_file` | Temporary paths isolated per test. |

```python
from __future__ import annotations

from flext_core import FlextSettings
from flext_tests import FlextTestsSettings


def test_settings_isolation(settings: FlextTestsSettings) -> None:
    settings.debug = True
    # Next test receives a fresh singleton via reset_settings
    assert FlextSettings.fetch_global() is not settings
```

## Resetting singletons manually

When a fixture is not enough:

```python
from flext_core import FlextContainer, FlextSettings
from flext_tests import FlextTestsSettings

FlextSettings.reset_for_testing()
FlextTestsSettings.reset_for_testing()
FlextContainer.reset_for_testing()
```

## Testing result flows

Use the `r` alias instead of importing from `returns` directly:

```python
def test_safe_divide() -> None:
    result = safe_divide(10, 2)
    assert result.success
    assert result.unwrap() == 5.0

    failure = safe_divide(10, 0)
    assert failure.failure
```

## Good practices

- Rely on `reset_settings` and `test_runtime` for isolation.
- Assert public API behavior, not private internals.
- Use `settings_factory` when a project-specific settings subclass is required.
- Assert result state via `.success`, `.failure`, and `.unwrap()` on `r[T]` instances.

## Make/codegen boundary

`flext_tests` owns test fixtures, models, assertions, and public-behavior test
support only. It does not own a Make registry, dispatcher, generator, or
workspace inventory.

Repository conformance and the complete generated Makefile are owned solely by
`flext-infra codegen conform`. The generated surface exposes `help` plus twelve
operational verbs; each action has one verb, one `WHAT` selector, and one
canonical handler. Project-specific behavior is confined to validated private
handlers in `custom.mk`.

Tests for this contract exercise the generated public commands and observable
artifacts. They do not reproduce command metadata or assert private routing
implementation. See
ADR-004 for
the canonical decision.

## Bad practices

```python
# Mutating global singleton without resetting
FlextSettings.fetch_global().debug = True

# Importing returns directly instead of using the r alias
```

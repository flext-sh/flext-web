Security practices are governed by project-specific policies and central architecture
ADRs.

## Dependabot vulnerability governance

- The official security alert inventory is at:
  - `docs/reports/dependabot-alerts-2026-06-24.md`
- The current plan covers three fronts:
  - inventory alerts by severity and package,
  - group remediations into waves (critical/high first),
  - expand Dependabot to track Python modules with `pyproject.toml` in the monorepo.
- Security execution must record evidence per action (alert, fix commit, and closure
  status) in the bead tracker, without closing without a trail.

`make help` at the workspace root is the executable authority for command grammar. This
guide records the invariants that every declared verb must keep.

## Discover commands

```bash
make setup
make help
```

Never infer a target, flag, or selector from historical documentation. When a required
verb is missing or broken, repair the root dispatcher owner and rerun that verb.

## Canonical workflow

Use the standard verbs directly from the workspace root:

```bash
make setup
make gen
make mod
make gen
make gen
make fix
make fmt
make check
make test
make build
```

The consecutive generation passes prove the fixed point after structural rewrites.
`make build` packages the validated candidate; it does not replace runtime verification.
Each verb executes its declared operation directly. No project, file, pattern, action,
phase, fix, or changed-only selector may be attached to a standard verb.

`make help` is the complete live inventory. Additional declared verbs such as `upg`,
`docs`, `audit`, `status`, `waza`, `duplication`, and the release verbs retain their own
single operation and are invoked only when their scope applies.

## Verb single-pass contract

Each mutating verb owns exactly one operation per tool, and `make check` is strictly
read-only — no verb repeats another verb's work across the canonical sequence
`make fix && make fmt && make check`:

| Gate / tool                       | `make check` (read-only)           | `make fmt` (formatters) | `make fix` (one mutation)                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `lint` — ruff                     | read-only `ruff` verdict           | —                       | one `ruff` repair pass                     |
| `format` — ruff                   | — (mutating)                       | `ruff` format pass      | —                                          |
| `markdown` — rumdl                | `rumdl check`                      | —                       | `rumdl fmt`                                |
| `markdown-format` — prettier      | `prettier --check`                 | `prettier --write`      | —                                          |
| `markdown-code` — ruff (embedded) | format verdict on parseable blocks | —                       | one format pass, clean round-trips spliced |
| `canonical-alias`, `smells`       | read-only scan                     | —                       | declared repair                            |

`make fmt` never runs a lint pass and `make fix` never formats: each operation runs once
per verb, residue found by a mutation is reported there and enforced only by
`make check`, and `make fix`/`make fmt` repeated on a green tree are no-ops.

## Markdown quality pipeline

The markdown standard lives once in `flext-infra/config/tooling.yaml`
(`Infra.tooling.tools.markdown`) and is projected to every repository by `make gen`:

- `rumdl` is the linter (markdownlint-compatible `MD*` rules through the generated
  `.markdownlint.json` / `.markdownlintignore`); syntax findings inside embedded code
  belong to the flext-tests markdown validator, not to a second linter.
- `prettier` (pinned 3.5.x — newer releases dropped prose reflow) is the formatter:
  `prettier --check` in `make check`, `prettier --write` in `make fmt`.
- `markdown-code` holds parseable embedded Python and doctest examples to the
  ruff-format contract; unparseable documentation fragments are prose and stay with the
  validator. Generated and provider-projected trees (`.agents`, `.claude`, `.gemini`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `target/`, and friends) are excluded by the same SSOT list.

## Test contract

`make test` runs the incremental selection. `make test-full` first runs that operation,
then the complete suite, including configured external and CI-excluded markers. The
runner owns this sequence, one monotonic deadline, and the same persistent Testmon
database, located by the flext-infra generated configuration. External tests keep their
declared runtime and authentication requirements. Direct runner commands and
cache-clearing bypasses are prohibited.

Separate receipts preserve each phase's mode, raw result, inventory, execution, and
deselection counts. Warnings are counted per subprocess and globally, including any
explicitly suspended MRO warnings. Only a typed incremental cache hit with database
integrity checks and complete deselection accounting may execute zero tests; it is never
reported as tests passed. The full phase must execute its complete nonempty inventory.

## Failure contract

- The first exception, traceback, and non-zero exit propagate unchanged.
- Warnings, skips, empty output, and missing tools are failures.
- No retry, fallback, suppression, normalization, partial run, or alternate raw tool
  path can replace the canonical verb.

## Scope and generation

The root dispatcher resolves workspace scope from its typed topology. Generated Make
surfaces and documentation are changed at their template or configuration owner, then
regenerated with `make gen`.

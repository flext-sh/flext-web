`make help` at the workspace root is the executable authority for command grammar. This
guide records the invariants that every declared verb must keep.

## Discover commands

```bash
make setup
make help
```

Never infer a target, flag, or selector from historical documentation. When a required
verb is missing or broken, repair the root dispatcher owner and rerun that verb.

## Canonical workflow

Use the standard verbs directly from the workspace root:

```bash
make setup
make gen
make mod
make gen
make gen
make fix
make fmt
make check
make test
make build
```

The consecutive generation passes prove the fixed point after structural rewrites.
`make build` packages the validated candidate; it does not replace runtime verification.
Each verb executes its declared operation directly. No project, file, pattern, action,
phase, fix, or changed-only selector may be attached to a standard verb.

`make help` is the complete live inventory. Additional declared verbs such as `deps`,
`docs`, `audit`, `status`, `waza`, `duplication`, and the release verbs retain their own
single operation and are invoked only when their scope applies.

## Test contract

Every test execution uses `make test`. The verb owns impact selection and the retained
Testmon cache, including complete-suite requests. Direct test-runner commands and
cache-clearing bypasses are prohibited.

## Failure contract

- The first exception, traceback, and non-zero exit propagate unchanged.
- Warnings, skips, empty output, and missing tools are failures.
- No retry, fallback, suppression, normalization, partial run, or alternate raw tool
  path can replace the canonical verb.

## Scope and generation

The root dispatcher resolves workspace scope from its typed topology. Generated Make
surfaces and documentation are changed at their template or configuration owner, then
regenerated with `make gen`.

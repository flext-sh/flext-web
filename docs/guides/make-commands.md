`make help` at the workspace root is the executable authority for command grammar. This
guide records the invariants that every declared verb must keep.

## Discover commands

```bash
make setup
make help
```

Never infer a target, flag, or selector from historical documentation. When a required
verb is missing or broken, repair the root dispatcher owner and rerun that verb.

## Canonical workflow

Use the standard verbs directly from the workspace root:

```bash
make setup
make gen
make mod
make gen
make gen
make fix
make fmt
make check
make test
make build
```

The consecutive generation passes prove the fixed point after structural rewrites.
`make build` packages the validated candidate; it does not replace runtime verification.
Each verb executes its declared operation directly. No project, file, pattern, action,
phase, fix, or changed-only selector may be attached to a standard verb.

`make help` is the complete live inventory. Additional declared verbs such as `deps`,
`docs`, `audit`, `status`, `waza`, `duplication`, and the release verbs retain their own
single operation and are invoked only when their scope applies.

## Verb single-pass contract

Each mutating verb owns exactly one operation per tool, and `make check` is strictly
read-only — no verb repeats another verb's work across the canonical sequence
`make fix && make fmt && make check`:

| Gate / tool                       | `make check` (read-only)           | `make fmt` (formatters) | `make fix` (one mutation)                  |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `lint` — ruff                     | read-only `ruff` verdict           | —                       | one `ruff` repair pass                     |
| `format` — ruff                   | — (mutating)                       | `ruff` format pass      | —                                          |
| `markdown` — rumdl                | `rumdl check`                      | —                       | `rumdl fmt`                                |
| `markdown-format` — prettier      | `prettier --check`                 | `prettier --write`      | —                                          |
| `markdown-code` — ruff (embedded) | format verdict on parseable blocks | —                       | one format pass, clean round-trips spliced |
| `canonical-alias`, `smells`       | read-only scan                     | —                       | declared repair                            |

`make fmt` never runs a lint pass and `make fix` never formats: each operation runs once
per verb, residue found by a mutation is reported there and enforced only by
`make check`, and `make fix`/`make fmt` repeated on a green tree are no-ops.

## Markdown quality pipeline

The markdown standard lives once in `flext-infra/config/tooling.yaml`
(`Infra.tooling.tools.markdown`) and is projected to every repository by `make gen`:

- `rumdl` is the linter (markdownlint-compatible `MD*` rules through the generated
  `.markdownlint.json` / `.markdownlintignore`); syntax findings inside embedded code
  belong to the flext-tests markdown validator, not to a second linter.
- `prettier` (pinned 3.5.x — newer releases dropped prose reflow) is the formatter:
  `prettier --check` in `make check`, `prettier --write` in `make fmt`.
- `markdown-code` holds parseable embedded Python and doctest examples to the
  ruff-format contract; unparseable documentation fragments are prose and stay with the
  validator. Generated and provider-projected trees (`.agents`, `.claude`, `.gemini`,
  `AGENTS.md`, `target/`, and friends) are excluded by the same SSOT list.

## Test contract

Every test execution uses `make test`. The verb owns impact selection and the retained
Testmon cache, including complete-suite requests. Direct test-runner commands and
cache-clearing bypasses are prohibited.

## Failure contract

- The first exception, traceback, and non-zero exit propagate unchanged.
- Warnings, skips, empty output, and missing tools are failures.
- No retry, fallback, suppression, normalization, partial run, or alternate raw tool
  path can replace the canonical verb.

## Scope and generation

The root dispatcher resolves workspace scope from its typed topology. Generated Make
surfaces and documentation are changed at their template or configuration owner, then
regenerated with `make gen`.

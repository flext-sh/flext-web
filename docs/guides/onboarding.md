> Project profile: `flext-web`

Use this sequence before changing any FLEXT package. All actions start at the
workspace root.

## Resolve authority

Read, in order:

1. the workspace root `AGENTS.md`;
2. the branch-matched `flext-law` skill;
3. the nearest package `AGENTS.md`;
4. the active Bead and its current evidence.

Confirm the package's canonical config, settings, public API, and owned `c`, `t`,
`p`, `m`, and `u` surfaces before adding or moving a symbol.

## Prepare and discover

```bash
make setup APPLY=Y
make help
```

The workspace virtual environment and root dispatcher are the only command
surface. Never enter a member directory to run a parallel tool command.

## Establish the baseline

```bash
make gen APPLY=Y
make fix APPLY=Y
make fmt APPLY=Y
make check APPLY=Y
make test APPLY=Y
make conform APPLY=Y
```

Tests run only through the retained Testmon cache. Warnings, skips, empty
collection, missing tools, and suppressed failures are red.

## Change safely

- Use semantic refactoring automation for hierarchy discovery and rewiring.
- Put generic reusable behavior in canonical `c`, `t`, `p`, `m`, or `u`
  ownership.
- Exercise only public facades with `tm`, the unified `conftest.py`, and typed
  shared fixtures.
- Do not use mocks, fakes, stubs, patching, monkeypatch mutation, private
  construction, or hardcoded project values.
- Remove the old owner after every consumer is rewired; leave no compatibility
  path or duplicate registry.

## Generated surfaces

Change the source owner, then regenerate and prove the fixed point:

```bash
make gen APPLY=Y
make mod APPLY=Y
make gen APPLY=Y
make gen APPLY=Y
```

Generated member guides identify their root source and exact regeneration rule.
Never edit those projections by hand.

## Command grammar

Do not add project, file, pattern, phase, fix, or changed-only selectors to the
standard verbs. If `make help` does not expose a required workflow, repair its
canonical Make owner before continuing.

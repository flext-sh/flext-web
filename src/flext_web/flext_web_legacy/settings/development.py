"""Development settings for FLEXT Meltano Enterprise Web application.

This module provides development-specific Django settings that extend the base
configuration with debugging tools and development-friendly features.

Features:
            - Debug mode enabled with detailed error pages
    - Django Debug Toolbar for performance profiling
    - Console email backend for testing email functionality
    - Permissive CORS settings for frontend development
    - Dummy caching to avoid Redis dependency in development
    - Hot reloading support for template and static file changes

Warning:
-------
    These settings should NEVER be used in production environments
    as they expose sensitive debugging information.
